# Files

  1. The CodeBook.md describes the how to use variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to get and clean up the data.

  2. The run_analysis.R contains the code to perform the analysis. They can be launched in RStudio. we are going do the follow:

     b. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
     
     c. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
     
     d. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
     
     f. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

   3. The tidyData.txt is the output of the file
